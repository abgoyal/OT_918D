/* The S1 button state is provided by GPIO pin 1. But as this
 * pin is also used for uart input as alternate function, the
 * operational modes must be switched first:
 * 1) disable uart using set_latch_u5()
 * 2) turn off alternate function implicitly through
 *    gpio_direction_input()
 * 3) read the GPIO's current value
 * 4) undo step 2 by enabling alternate function (in this
 *    mode the GPIO direction is fixed, so no change needed)
 * 5) turn on uart again
 * The GPIO value occurs to be inverted, so pin high means
 * button is not pressed.
