 * is reserved for motherboard devices that decode all 16
 * bits, so it's ok to allocate at, say, 0x2800-0x28ff,
 * but we want to try to avoid allocating at 0x2900-0x2bff
 * which might have be mirrored at 0x0100-0x03ff..

/*
 *  Handle resources of PCI devices.  If the world were perfect, we could
 *  just allocate all the resource regions and do nothing more.  It isn't.
 *  On the other hand, we cannot just re-allocate all devices, as it would
 *  require us to know lots of host bridge internals.  So we attempt to
 *  keep as much of the original configuration as possible, but tweak it
 *  when it's found to be wrong.
 *
 *  Known BIOS problems we have to work around:
 *	- I/O or memory regions not configured
 *	- regions configured, but not enabled in the command register
 *	- bogus I/O addresses above 64K used
 *	- expansion ROMs left enabled (this may sound harmless, but given
 *	  the fact the PCI specs explicitly allow address decoders to be
 *	  shared between expansion ROMs and other resource regions, it's
 *	  at least dangerous)
 *
 *  Our solution:
 *	(1) Allocate resources for all buses behind PCI-to-PCI bridges.
 *	    This gives us fixed barriers on where we can allocate.
 *	(2) Allocate resources for all enabled devices.  If there is
 *	    a collision, just mark the resource as unallocated. Also
 *	    disable expansion ROMs during this step.
 *	(3) Try to allocate resources for disabled devices.  If the
 *	    resources were assigned correctly, everything goes well,
 *	    if they weren't, they won't disturb allocation of other
 *	    resources.
 *	(4) Assign new addresses to resources which were either
 *	    not configured at all or misconfigured.  If explicitly
 *	    requested by the user, configure expansion ROM address
 *	    as well.
