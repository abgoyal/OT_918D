 * INET		An implementation of the TCP/IP protocol suite for the LINUX
 *		operating system.  INET is implemented using the  BSD Socket
 *		interface as the means of communication with the user level.
 *
 *		IP/TCP/UDP checksumming routines
 *
 * Authors:	Jorge Cwik, <jorge@laser.satlink.net>
 *		Arnt Gulbrandsen, <agulbra@nvg.unit.no>
 *		Tom May, <ftom@netcom.com>
 *		Andreas Schwab, <schwab@issan.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>
 *		Lots of code moved from tcp.c and ip.c; see those files
 *		for more names.
 *
 * 03/02/96	Jes Sorensen, Andreas Schwab, Roman Hodek:
 *		Fixed some nasty bugs, causing some horrible crashes.
 *		A: At some points, the sum (%0) was used as
 *		length-counter instead of the length counter
 *		(%1). Thanks to Roman Hodek for pointing this out.
 *		B: GCC seems to mess up if one uses too many
 *		data-registers to hold input values and one tries to
 *		specify d0 and d1 as scratch registers. Letting gcc choose these
 *      registers itself solves the problem.
